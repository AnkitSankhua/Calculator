1. Menu Display : The code starts by displaying a user-friendly menu listing various mathematical operations. Each operation is assigned a number for user selection.

2. User Input : It then prompts the user to choose an operation by entering the corresponding number. Additionally, the user is asked to input one or two numeric values, depending on the chosen operation.

3. Arithmetic Operations :
   - Addition : If the user selects addition, the code computes the sum of the two provided numbers and displays the result.
   - Subtraction : For subtraction, it calculates the difference between the numbers and presents the result.
   - Multiplication : When multiplication is chosen, the code performs the multiplication operation and provides the outcome.
   - Division : Division is supported with proper error checking to prevent division by zero. It returns the quotient of the two numbers.
   
4. Other Mathematical Functions :
   - Square : If the user opts for squaring a number, the code calculates the square of the first input.
   - Power : For power operations, the code raises the first number to an exponent specified by the user.
   - Square Root : It handles square root calculations, ensuring the input is non-negative, and displays the square root of the first input.
   - Absolute Value : Absolute value computation is also included, providing the absolute value of the first input.

5. Error Handling : The code includes error handling mechanisms. It checks for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values, and displays appropriate error messages when necessary.

6. Continuity : The program runs within a loop, allowing users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the code. Users can choose to exit the calculator when they are done.

This Python code offers an interactive and versatile calculator capable of handling a variety of mathematical tasks. 
It ensures a user-friendly experience by presenting a menu of options, conducting computations accurately, and addressing potential input errors.
Users can utilize this calculator for a wide range of calculations and continue to do so until they decide to exit the program.
